# Target-Planet
Fun games to play with your camera.

### Stuff Finder
In this Game, both players will have 30sec to take a photo of a random item chosen by the app. Then, the Computer Vision IA will check if the photo corresponds.
Let's run around the house !

### Speed Writer
Here, both player will have to write a random text chosen by the app, then buzz their button when they have finished.
The first player which did that have to take a photo of his text, the other can continue to write. If it's correct, he wins the game, else, the second player can take a photo and maybe win.
Patience or speed ? Anyway, it's risky !

### Face Fighter
A random emotion is asked by the app. Both of the player have to make it as best as possible. The IA will recognize who did it the best.
Don't worry, we don't save your photo (but it could be funny) !
